Hi! I'm Megan, and currently I’m the Senior Email Developer at Sinch. I oversee the email design system and develop emails for all Sinch Email brands, which include Sinch Mailgun, Sinch Mailjet, and Sinch Email on Acid. Besides coding up some really cool emails, I act as a developer advocate to the email community, contributing to the Email on Acid blog and host Email on Acid’s “Notes from the Dev: Video Edition”

I believe in being a good human. What does this mean? In my work life, this means developing good, accessible emails that can be read by anyone, anywhere, no matter their abilities or device set up. 

Being a good human means working towards a more kind and compassionate world where everyone is treated equally and equitably.

I’m deeply committed to lifting up voices that are not my own, and you’ll see that reflected in projects that I take on. 

As a graphic designer, working on email has always been a key responsibility. My career in email really took flight while working on two initiatives.

In 2014, I co-founded Mango & Marigold Press (formerly Bharat Babies), an award-winning independent publishing house that shares the sweet and savory stories of the South Asian experience. Here, I worked on all branding, design, and general technology needs, including email.

From 2017-2021 I worked as the email marketing specialist at the Harold Grinspoon Foundation. I built the email program up to a combination of monthly newsletters, solicitation campaigns, service emails, and more. I managed the email program from design/development through post-send reporting.

I believe that well-designed emails can transform the way businesses communicate with their customers and create positive change.
